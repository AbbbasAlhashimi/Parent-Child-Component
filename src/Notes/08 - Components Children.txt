When we create a component an HTML component like Button and want to call its values, we need to use props.
However, if we don't specify the props type as children, the values between the starting and ending tags will not be read.
Therefore, we need to specify the passed on props children to allow the REACT to read the child contents of the HTML.


export default function TabButton({children})
{
    return(
    <li>
        <button>{children}</button>
    </li>
);
}
