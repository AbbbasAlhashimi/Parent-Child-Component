The first step into clean coding, is to isolate components from the App.js
to begin, we need to create a new component for each function. One of which is the Header function

We begin the transfer by creating a separate component in the newly created Component folder.
We call it Header.jsx and begin the function with [export default] so we can export the contents to the App.js file


export default function Header() {
    return (
      <header>
        <img src={reactImg} alt="Stylized atom" />
        <h1>React Essentials</h1>
        <p>
          React concepts you will need for almost any app you are going to build!
        </p>
      </header>
    );
  }

  Then we import the function into the App.js by adding the following line: [import Header from './components/Header.jsx';]
